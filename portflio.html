This is an old story. It was first told long ago. A rich man wanted to make a journey to another town. He was a businessman. He wanted to take things to sell.  He also wanted to take gold to buy things with. He decided to take ten servants with him. They would carry the   things to sell and the gold, and also food to eat on the journey.
He was a kind man. He said to one of his servants: ‘You are the smallest, the thinnest and the weakest of all my servants. You cannot carry a heavy load. You must choose the lightest load to carry.’
The servants thanked his master for his kindness.  He pointed to the biggest load. This was bread to eat on the journey.
His master said, ‘You are foolish. That is the biggest and heaviest load.’ But the servant picked up the load cheerfully and the journey began. They walked for the four hours. Then they stopped for a rest. They all ate some of the bread. Then there was less bread for the servant to carry. Every day they ate more bread and there was less bread to carry .They servants load grew smaller and lighter every day. At  the end of the journey, the clever servant he nothing to carry
